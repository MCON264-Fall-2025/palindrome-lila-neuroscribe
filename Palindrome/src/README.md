# Strategies to Check for Palindromes
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). There are several strategies to check if a given string is a palindrome. Here are some common methods:
There are two primary strategies to check for palindromes:
One is called Two-Pointer Technique, and the other is Stack-Queue Technique.
